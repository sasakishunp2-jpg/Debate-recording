JeW_hOW70sw,LSE Open 2024 Open Final,"- Under the Shani Ageing Process, the rate at which adults age is directly tied to the difference between their Carbon Footprint and the Carbon Footprint Benchmark. - The Carbon Footprint Benchmark is the level of Carbon Footprint on a per capita basis that would maintain the current status of the climate. - The Carbon Footprint Benchmark changes over time to account for the state of the climate. o For example, in 2024 the Carbon Footprint Benchmark may be X units; however, if by 2034, the health of the climate has improved, the Carbon Footprint Benchmark would increase, e.g. to X+2 units – i.e. individuals would be able to generate a higher Carbon Footprint before they reached the Carbon Footprint Benchmark. - An individual’s Carbon Footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, emitted directly or indirectly by an individual; factors such as an individual’s energy usage, travel habits, dietary choices, and consumption patterns are taken into account. - Individuals with Carbon Footprints above the Carbon Footprint Benchmark age faster than natural, while those with Carbon Footprints lower than the Carbon Footprint Benchmark age slower than natural. - The rate at which you age is linear not exponential (i.e. every Carbon Footprint unit above or below the Carbon Footprint Benchmark has the same impact on ageing as the previous unit). - For example, consider two individuals, Abhi and Charlie, who are the same age but have different Carbon Footprints. o Abhi, who lives a sustainable lifestyle with minimal carbon emissions, may age at a rate equivalent to one year for every 18 months that pass. o In contrast, Charlie, whose lifestyle is characterised by high carbon emissions from excessive consumption and travel, may age at a rate of one year for every nine months that pass. - An individual’s Carbon Footprint is discounted by the degree of choice they had over the relevant act. o For example, consider two other individuals, Bob and Anna, if Bob invites Anna for lunch and makes steak, and they both eat the same amount of it, Bob’s Carbon Footprint would be higher than Anna if he had decided, without Anna’s input, to serve steak rather than a more environmentally friendly option. - The Shani Ageing Process does not affect one’s ability to die for causes not related to ageing. - In a world with the Shani Ageing Process, people’s understanding of it would mirror their understanding of the natural ageing process in the current world.

NcSI-Z-Qovg,Vietnam WUDC 2024 Round 2,"Infoslide: There are two ways that governments can consider disadvantage in policy-making. The ""integrated model"" incorporates disadvantage as an inherent consideration in policy-making (e.g. all new policies made in the education department must consider implications for rural students). The ""specialty model"" involves having a distinct division that specifically engages with policy for disadvantaged groups (e.g. the education department has a division that directly and separately addresses helping rural areas).

WhUT16hNgaU,Erasmus Rotterdam Open 2023 Grand Final,"Info slide: The Reality Splitter is a technology which, when utilised, can “split” geographic areas into two localised parallel dimensions occupying the same geographic space. Once “split,” changes in one localised parallel dimension do not affect events that go on in the other. However, space outside the area in which the Reality Splitter is used is entirely unaffected. When people enter a physical area in which the Reality Splitter was used for the first time, they must choose up to one of the parallel dimensions to enter. Once that person chooses which dimension to enter, they will only ever “see” that dimension when they occupy that physical area for the rest of their lives. For example, if someone were to use the Reality Splitter in a forest, two forests occupying the same overlapping space would now exist. In one dimension, people could remove trees from the forest, while in the other dimension the forest would be entirely unaffected.

A reserve currency is a foreign currency that is held in significant quantities by central banks or other monetary authorities as part of their foreign exchange reserves. The reserve currency can be used in international transactions, international investments and all aspects of the global economy. These measures by China include: including conducting bilateral trade and investment in Yuan rather than USD, creating alternative banking systems, making it easier to conduct international transactions outside of USD, and gradually alleviating capital controls (regulations that restrict or prohibit the movement of capital across national borders). 1 OG 82 82 2 CG 81 80 3 OO 78 79 4 CO 76 76",economics;international relation;law;social movement

They are currently deciding which game they will continue production on and which game they will halt production on. In 'DoxBot 420', the game’s mechanics would prioritise a very high degree of skill expression (like Starcraft, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or Chess). In games of this nature, the skill of a player or team of players has a very high degree of influence on the outcome of the game. In 'DoxTastic 2077', the game’s mechanics would prioritise unexpected outcomes and randomness (like Mario Kart, Fall Guys or Uno). In games of this nature, the skill of a player or team of players has much less influence on the outcome of the game.
